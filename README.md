# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where Tailwind CSS classes, despite being correctly defined and imported, fail to apply to elements in the rendered HTML.  The problem is not caused by simple typos or build process errors; it's a more subtle issue likely stemming from unexpected CSS specificity conflicts, or incorrect class naming conventions when using Tailwind's utility-first approach.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions will be provided in the relevant file).
3. Observe that the `bg-red-500` class is not being applied to the relevant HTML element, even though it's correctly defined in `tailwind.config.js` and imported into the CSS.

## Solution

The solution lies in understanding and correctly managing CSS specificity. The solution file offers insights and corrections to resolve the issue, along with explanations.
